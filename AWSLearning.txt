1. AWS(Amazon web services) is the similar cloud platform provided by Amazon to allow user to build /deploy/manage their App or service and use the existing service that AWS have to host the app and make it available to the user , just like we did it in Microsoft Azure .
2. We can spun the virtual machine logon to it and install the mondate software like Git to clone the app on it , and use java to run it as a microservice and 
olaa the app is up for the user.

Lambda
Batch
Elastic Beanstalk
Serverless Application Repository
AWS Outposts
EC2 Image Builder
AWS App Runner


2. Storage

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are going to cover Amazon VPC(virtual private cloud network)  and EC2 

1. Global Infra : It means the wide spread of AWS datacenters across the globe . This data center spread will allow users to choose the DC for hosting their application to give best (low latency) experience to their users who will access that app.

2. CloudPing.info : its a AWS tool that will go and ping all AWS DCs to show the HTTP ping response time back to your location. That will help you choose the DCs you want. for me its Asia Pacific (Mumbai)	39 ms is the best Dc to choose.

3. Price : The pricing tier also changes from region to region . Ex of regions Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Behrain) etc 

4. AWS VPC	: AWS Virtual private cloud network : Its similar to what we study in Azure as Azure VPN in azure cloud space.
		AWS VPC : will be a separate isolated space with IP range in AWS cloud. Now in AWS VPC we can spin up the Virtual machines with allocated private IP Addresses so that these machines can communicate with eachother .
		
		Private IPaddress :  will allow VMs in AWS /AZURE VPN to talk to each other .
		Public IPaddress : will allow VMs from AWS / Azure VPN to talk to the internet.
		Subnets : A AZURE / AWS VPN contains subnets which will further have there own address space of private or public IP .
		Default VPC : it is created Automatically by AWS once account is active . IP address apce : 172.31.0.0/16

5. EC2(Amazon Elastic Compute) : this will allow user to spin up the VMs on cloud without worrying about the underlying infra (storage , operation system , cooling system , network etc ). We can terminate and respin the VM once needed.		
		
a. Each virtual server that you create via this service is known as an instance.

b. You can choose from various configurations of CPU, memory, storage for the instance.

c. You can choose from a set of Preconfigured templates known as Amazon Machine Images(linux(ubuntu , centos etc ) or windows(windows 2016 , windows 2019 etc )). These templates will determine what is the underlying operating system for your machine.

d. You can allocate volumes to the instance

e. You can set firewall rules via Security Groups
		
		Steps to create an EC2 instances : 
			Select the region 
			select the Amazon machine image (linux or windows )
			Select the instance type (usually ask for cpu count and memmory)
			select the VPC , the default or create a new one 
			select the storage 0amount 
			select configuring security group ,just like a firewall. Just like we have NSG in azure that contains the inbound and outbound rule , same in this we have inbound and outbound rule.
			create a key pair which we will use to login . 
f. we can then use the login key to get decrypt and generate the password for RDP to windows VM or ssh to linux VM .
	We can do 
		First use putty key generater to use the .pem file to create a .ppk file 
		Then use putty to enter the host and in SSH --- > auth ---> give that .ppk file .
		login using user name : ubuntu and enter the passphrase you gave while cretaing the .ppk file .
		sudo apt-get update 
		sudo apt-get install ngnix
	then hit localhost:80 to check the web server is running or not ?

g. VOlume attached to VM is separate resource that will be chargeable.	
			
6. EC2 pricing : 
			instance type  : medium  , large , x.large 
			memory : price increase as it increases 
			OS : price also changes as the os changes .
			Region : the price of changes as the regions changes .
		Pricing for the EBS volume or disk is seperate 

NOTE  : EVEN IF YOU SHUTDOWN THE VM , YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED FOR COMPUTE PROCESSING BUT WILL BE CHARGED FOR THE EBS VOLUME YOU HAVE AS IT IS STILL INTACT.		

7. INSTANCE TYPES : ON THE BASIS OF OS , MEMORY AND OTHER PARAMETERS FOLLOWING ARE THE CATEGORIES WE HAVE .
EACH CATEGORIES HAVE ITS OWN TYPES OF INSTANCES .

	a. General Purpose 
	b. Compute optimized 
	c. Memory optimized 
	d. Accelerated computing 
	e. Storage Optimized 
	f. Instance fetaure 
	g. measuring instance performance.
	
8. INSTANCE PURCHASING OPTIONS : 
		
	a. spot instance : 
		-here we can get an EC2 component at much lower cost  then on-demand pricing.
		-the EC2 component will be provided on the basis of EC2 capacity
		-here if the capacity from AWS become less then that spot instance will be shutdown and taken away from usr.
		-If the instance is taken form us , then it can be restarted or the app which also running on that instance can be brought up again when spot instance is given back to you . Used for data analysis , batch processing.
		-these spot instance can't be stop and start , it can only be restart and terminated .
	
	b. 	Reserved instances 
		- As the name says , you are willing to reserve an instance for a year or so , then only you will get a billing discount.
		- this is a billing discount fetaure on the bsis of the reservation of instance.
		- we can pay , partial , entire or no payment at the starting. But obviousely giving an upfront payment will provide a better discount.
		- Offering classes of instances in reserved category 
			: standard - here we can change the size of the instance with in the term commited 
			: convertible - here we can change the instance family , instance type , platform , scope and 	tenancy.
		- depends upon the 
			: os 
			: tenancy
			: instance type , t2.micro etc 
			: term 
			: offering class 
			: payment options 

9. Dedicated Infrastructure for EC2.

	a. Amazon EC2 dedicated host : As we know when we spun up the vm on-demand , the VM can comes up on the host and when we stop and start the VM, the VM may comes up on 
	the same physical machine in Amazon data centers or on different .
	So to have more controll to above process , the client request for amazon dedicated hosts , in which the VM post restarting comes up on the same machine all the time . NOTE  : BUT THE PRICING IS MORE FOR THIS. We can apply our licenses to the physical machine .
	
	b. Amazon EC2 dedicated instances : In this case the VM instance will be assign to the dediated host / physical machine, but we will not have complete control over the machine sockets and physical cores. So we can not bring our own licenses to the machine as complete control is not there .
	
10. Elastic Block storage  (EBS volume) : 

-Its a separate resource created when we spin up the EC2 VM instances.
-You will get charged separately for this seperate resource 
-when you terminate the EC2 instance , make sure to delete the attached EBS volumes .
-We can attach or detach a new EBS volume disk at any point of time .
-we can increase the size of the volume any time .
-both the EC2 instance and EBS volumes should be in same region.
-the EBS volumes is replicated with in same availability zone for future hardware failure 
-even post detaching the volumes the data can persist for longer period of time.

availability region ---------contains 1 or many ---------> availability zones (data centers)
south-mumbai -----------------------------------> Data centers ---------------> many physical machine 


CATEGORIES of volumes types : 
	-General purpose SSD(solid state drive ) : 16000 IOPS per vol
	-Provisioned SSD : for business critical  : 64000 IOPS per vol
	-Throughput HDD (hard disk device ): for highly or frequently accessible data . Low cost HD volumes .
	-COLD HDD : for less frequent accessible data . used to store archive data.

11. Attaching additional vol to instance.
		- Create volume in same availability zone as the instance is runing .
		- Go to volumes  ---- > enter the details and ollaa the volume created .
		- In volumes --- > Actions --- > Attach --- > search ofr instance.	
		- Login to your instance windows -- > server manger -- > file storage -- > Disks -- > new disk see --> bring it online ---> initialize the disk ---> create new volume out of the disk.

12. EBS snapshot : 
			-Its a fetaure to take the backup of the EC2 instance. Just like creating an static image of the VM or instance .
			-Once you take the snapshot of the instance , we can create a volume out of it 
			-The volume created out of the snapshot can be attached to the other EC2 instances.
			-Steps :	
				.Go to actions --> click on create snapshot , choose the region --> done.
				. to create a volument : go to the snapshot created ---> click on action ---> click on create volume and done.
				
				
				
Note : We have EBS (ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE VOLUME) BELOW ONE IS ANOTHER VOLUME TYPE 				
13. Instance Store Volume : 
	-An instance store volume is attachable volume which resides on the same  host machine where your instance is running .
	-allow more faster and frequent access to the data.
	-disadvantage of data getting lost under below scenarios:
		.if the instance restarted.
		.if the instance terminated.
		.if the instance stop.
	-So if you need a volume to persist the data go for the EBS storage which resides on a separate host machine in data center.

14. Availability Zones : 
		
		1 availability region -----> multiple availability zones -----> each availability zone will have multiple data centers 
		AR = Availability Region 
		AZ = Availability Zones
		DC = data centers
