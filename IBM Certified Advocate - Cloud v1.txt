IBM Certified Advocate - Cloud v1

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.

Cloud computing : is enabling on cloud feature to spin up the resource in less amount of time and less manual interventions.

	1. Ondemand - provide the resource or increase the resources on demand
	2. Broad network acces : can be accessed view any device 
	3. Resource pooling : Economies of scale . Dynamically assigned and reassigned 
	4. Rapid Elasticity : Down or up scale the resource as per th eload 
	5. Measured service  : Pay as you go : n use no billing .


1. Deployment model : 
	public : usage is shared by other company  
	private : Usage is for single organisation
	hybrid : Mix of both public and private 

2. Service model : 
	Application SAAS : direct software install
	Platform PAAS : Provide under lying infa and provide hold onto the OS as well.
	Ifra(IAAS) : prvide the underlying infra 

3. Cloud computing evolution : 

4. Flexibility , ondemand increase of theresources , access cloud from anywhere .
5. No need to worry about the underlying infra and its maintainance
6.  hosted data can be access from anywhere and from any device 
7. hardware failure doesnot results in data loss , as data redundacny , fault tolerance and disaster recovery is applicable for the damage.

Key cloud srevice provide : 
AWS 
Azure (microsoft ) 
Google cloud platform(GCP) .
Aliyun (alibaba cloud) chinese cloud.
Salesforce.


8. Business case fr cloud computing 
First create an IBM cloud account : https://courses.cognitiveclass.ai/courses/course-v1:IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork+CC0101EN+v1/courseware/97dfd2321ab2469c9b8ebaaecf03a508/62c5ec272127473891cfc570811077a6/?child=first

9. pay-as-you-go and Spiningup the application in lower amount of time results in lower the risk for the companies to start adopting the Cloud .
	The above approach helps in avoiding huge upfront cost and maintainance of the underlying hardware even if when all or some of our apps and services are sitting idle and is not in use.
	
a. IOT Devices : internet of things : IOT is the platform powered by Cloud which is access using a smart phone of any device generating data . IOT devices helps in converting the digital data acceptable in cloud and be analyzed by the cloud back end and generate values.

case study : Maglvendon socitry in affrica using IOT devices connected to each Rhino to track their movement and ca also be warned before any one comes near to them 
Help them escape . Using these IOT devices connected to Each rhino the cloud is maintaining the dtaa count overall africa.

Note  : IN nutshell IOT devices generates data 

b. AI : Artificial intelligence 	: Now AI consumes data process and Leanr from the data generate from IOT devices .

C. Block chain and analytics :  Block chain is more similar to IOT . As IT devices connected to various data generating devices and send it to AI which help in learing from the event driving data generation , dysruption , error occured , . That complete set og data generated from theIOT devices will be USed by  AI to generate an analysed data sheet to allow organisation or the vendors to take supportive steps.				

Some case studies that demonstrate how the use of emerging technologies on the cloud is creating value for millions around the world.

o   The use of the Internet of Things on the cloud to combat poaching of endangered rhinos in South Africa

o   Artificial Intelligence on the cloud being leveraged to deliver unique digital experiences to millions of fans around the world by the United States Tennis Association

o   Blockchain on the cloud helping farmers reduce waste by building traceability and transparency in the food supply chain

o   The use of data analytics for driving predictive maintenance solutions for a city’s infrastructure by KONE


NOTE : CLOUD MOSTLY IS USED BECAUSE OF ITS WIDELY USED FEATURES : SCLABLE , FLIXIBLA E, PAY AS YOU GO , DISASTER RECOVERY , GLOBAL DISTIBURTION ETC 


Difference between IAAS  , PAAS and SAAS 
IAAS : In this arch the underlying srever , datacenters , cooling plant , wiring , network , power setup is maintained by the vendor. The choice of OS is users and then install the DB and etc 
PAAS : In this along with above IAAS resource , the vendor also maintained the underlying OS installed on the server.
SAAS : In this along with the above PAAS resources , the vendor also maintained the application and other pre-requisite need to run the app .

IAAS :  Maintain below resources : 
			Server devices   ------------ DCs
			Network devices	   ------------ virtualisation , api 
			storage devices    ------------ objects , block storage 

PAAS : 	Maintain below resources : 
			Server devices   ------------ DCs
			Network devices	   ------------ virtualisation , api 
			storage devices    ------------ objects , block storage 
			Operating system 
			application runtime 
			middleware 
			Apis 
			databases 

			as middleware and runtime are managed by the vendor , the developer can focus more on the app dev.
			As the data bses and runtime are mainatined by the vendor , then the user or dev have no control  over the updation of the OS . Or routine updation .

SAAS  : Maintain below resource : 
			Server devices   ------------ DCs
			Network devices	   ------------ virtualisation , api 
			storage devices    ------------ objects , block storage 
			security ----
			keep the code or the service on a centralized repo to be accessed by the user .
			
			example : email application , HRM , HCM , financial application , microsoft office.
			
		concerns : 
			Need constant network setup to access the software 
		Pros : 
			as it is SAAS , no need to maintain any IT infra 
			Storage , network etc 
			
----- Deployment model -------
Public 
private 
hybrid 			

1. Public : In this model all the resouurcse are presnet on cloud which are mainatained by the vendor and is solely responsible for maintaining the underlying infrastructure for the user's application to run . resource like : servers , storage , network , security and infrastructure all are maintained by the vendor or cloud provider . user by using the management console or UI can subscribe to these resource usage and pay as they use. Miltiple tenant and multi org 
	benefits : 
			Is benefetial for the orgs which have fluctuating storage and processing and infra need .
			On demand resource availability 
			No upfront or capital cost need to invest 
			Focus more on developing the application which need to be run on the cloud 
			We can scale up and scale down the resource as we need .
			Pay as you go subscription plans 
			pay for what you use. idle resources will not cost .
	cons : 
			low security and data sovereignty issue. As the data is present in shared resource in cloud more risk to hijacking , hacking of resource which leads to data leak and other issues.
			
2. 	Private : In this deployment model all the resources are managed on private cloud space for a single organisaton which can reside on-premises or on external cloud space .Keeping all the resources on private cloud organisation can have more control on the regulatory compliance of the apps , security patching and network security . 

		benefits : -All benefits are there which invludes easy and quick bring up of apps.
				   -Virtual private cloud (VPC) is the isolated space that is created for the user to spin their resources.
				   -Better security set up on network.
				   -Can apply compliance rules on the applications/resource which are developed for a single organisation.
				   -Easy portability of entire set up from one Data center to another as the space is not shared and is an isolated space for the org resources.
				   -User can spin up the resource like DB and other data resouce and allow the apps in public cloud to access the DB in the private clud using more secure way.
				   -can control the server OS patching , install there own software licenses .
				   
3. Hybrid cloud. : Its the best of both cloud private and public cloud. It connects the resources on-premises private cloud tp the resources in public cloud .
				-Organisations can deploy their applications which are more sensistive on private cloud and apps which are less sensistive and dynamics on public cloud . 
				-The private cloud resource can use the share space in public cloud on-demand as per their needs.
				-Portability is there as private cloud is used for more sensitive apps . like data bases and credentials storage or key storage for their apps.
				-We can port the private cloud not only to different DC but to the a new cloud providers.
				-This deployment is better then private and public model as this model will help apps running on private and public cloud connected to utilize the resource from each other without impacting the running apps on either side.
				- But it is recommended that the apps which are on-premises private cloud should utilise the resource from public cloud as pay as you go subscrption plan is there for the users.


---- Overview of Cloud infrastructure--------
1. Cloud infrastructure contains 
						1 Region-------->1 or more AZ(availability zones)----> 1 or more Data centers -----> multiple data wracks and pshysical machines.

								EaCh DC has its own Network , power supply and coopling system for the physical machines.
						Multiple region arch helps in disaster recovery .
						1 DC ----> 1 wrack ----> HyperVisors installed ------> provision VMs on that installed hypervisors . All are maintained by the Cloud provider. Except the virtual machine is provisioned by the end users.
						
2. Storage : We are by default getting local storage with each VMs spun up and Bare metal machine . But these local drives get lost when the VM is decommissioned. So we have below storage services : 
							-Both file and bloack storage are not distributed globally and have less security 
								File Storage 
								Bloack storage 
								
							- Where as the object storage is distributed globally over multiple regions .	
								Objects storage 
								
3. Networking : STN software networking.

---------------------Virtualization :------------
1. Hyper visors and Virtual machines are the core part of virtualisations 
Types of Hyper visors 
	1. type 1 : Which is also called as Bare metal hyper visors and is more frequently used hyper visors and provide less latency in network .
	2. type 2 : which is called hosted hyper visors which is less frequently used hyper v and provide more latency as compared to BM hyper v.
We can spin up multiple virtual machines on Hyper Visors and as each VM is independent from each other each VM can have different OS and can barely use the resources shared with hosted machine.

Benefits : 
		1. Lower downtime : as VMs are portable . we can shift the vm to other Hyper v running on a working Host or physicall machine . 
		2. Cost savings
		3. backup facilities 
		
Note : Hyper v is installed on Physical or host machines or a wrack and VM is installed or run on Hyper V.
