Need to learn : Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack

-------------
What is software development  :

Requirements
Design
Implementation (code)
Verification 
Maintenance
--------------------
Waterfall :
Stage to stage model . Each stage should complete to go to next stage .
It is unidirectional.
It can not broken in order to speed up the process.
The requirements are fixed and no ambiguous requirements.
Well understood deadlines and know the deadline date .
Documentation is done on design stage .

Cons :
We get the product out at the end.
Can take much longer time.
As everything is fixed , The requirements will change after long time and  will need to be added in the applications.
-------------------

Agile model : 
We believe in shorter release cycle .
Priority request : prioritize the cycle . (Work on important feature .)
Requirements change we can accommodate 
Less planning is required for less number of feature.
In Agile we release feature by feature after getting feedback from the customer.
The feature are dependent on other features then the dependencies will impose a problem for a complex model .
knowledge transfer is less effective . Not much Documentations is not there.
----------------------------------
Lean model : 
is same as agile .
focus on better quality of software. and em-powering the employee to a better learning scope.
eliminate the unused code .
assign the developer to a domain
later decision. less wastage in planning.
Focus in delivering.

------------------------------------
Why devops : Issue is different systems used by developers and OPS team 
Devops is a methodology or an idea that could solve the problem between Dev and ops team .

Devops take advantage of lean or agile method . Devops shortens the release cycle to a day rather then a month .
--------------------------------------------
What is devops?

Its a methodology or an idea for solving the problem between the developers and the operations team by automating the task .

Means the dev guy do know how to run the applications and when give it manually to the ops . 
But the env setup to run the similar application is pretty difficult to create it for the ops team.

Devops will automate the above process
--------------------------------------------
Devops Tools ,

Docker is used for containerization, virtualisation and puppet , ansible for configuration .
Container will wrap with all software required and we can run container anywhere.
Puppet and ensible : we can install software using these softwares.
Selenium is used for automation testing suit.
Nagios : shows dashboard that shows all services(applications) which are on different servers running.


Docker : containerization and virtual availability of the containers that will wrap up the app and the os required for it.
Kubernetes : used to orchestration : which will manage the containers deployed and handles the scaling and elastic . if one pod goes down and another comes up.
puppet/ansible : used for configuration and installing software .
selenium : will help in creating automation test suit.
nagios : it will show the dashboard for monitoring 
jenkins : for CI/CD pipelines for automating the process of building the app  , deploying the app and testing it in the environment.
