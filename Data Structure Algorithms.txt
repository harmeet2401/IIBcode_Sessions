
For beginners, it's essential to start with fundamental data structures and algorithms that form the basis of computer science and software development. Here are some common data structures and algorithms suitable for beginners:

Data Structures:

Arrays: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. Arrays are fundamental and widely used data structures.

Linked Lists: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node points to the next node in the sequence.

Stacks: A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are inserted and removed from one end, called the top.

Queues: A linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are inserted at the rear end and removed from the front end.

Trees: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Trees have a root node, parent-child relationships, and may have left and right subtrees.

Graphs: A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected.

Algorithms:

Sorting Algorithms: BISMQ

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

Searching Algorithms:

Linear Search
Binary Search (requires a sorted array)
Recursion: A technique in which a function calls itself to solve subproblems.

Graph Traversal Algorithms:

Depth-First Search (DFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Dynamic Programming: A technique to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant computations.

Greedy Algorithms: Algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

Divide and Conquer: A problem-solving strategy that involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them recursively, and then combining their solutions.

Backtracking: A technique to solve problems incrementally by making choices and backtracking when a solution cannot be found.
