Openshift training -----------------------------

1. The openshift container platform  or OCP is some thing that runs the applications.
2. Many resources are there which helps developers to deploy their applications to the ocp clusters and expose it to the end users. 
3. The openshift runs on multiple openshift cluster servers .
4. There are two categories or Planes in OCP servers : 
	a. Control plane : 
		- which contains the Rest Api , Data persistence and monitoring .
	b. Data plane : 
		- which contains the servers where the applications runs.
		
								--------------		       							----------------
								Control plane 				Deploy apps to 					
Developers ---------------->	 Rest api 				----------------------->		 Data plane 
																						ocp servers
			Send request																
			for our apps 		--------------		       							----------------	
			
			
			
Various tools provided By either redhat named as the sandbox or the desktop app to run the openshift which parallely runs the Control planes and the data planes.			


5. OCP cli  : its the command line interface to run the cmmand to deploy your app , manage the pods , containers , monitoring and logging the app logs etc.

6. OCP dashboard can also used to manage the same as we do it in OCL cli . but we have an advantage to automate using OCP cli code and make the deployment , auto conig , autoscaling easy.

NOte openshift 4 is the latest version in pursuit by Redhat.

Installion of dev tools to start working with the cli.

1. Docker Desktop  https://www.docker.com/get-started : to get the installer. to get the docker desktop. This will give you the docker cli also for your desktop to start playing wih container.

2. Openshift installtion : hosted sandbox env is better option to gowith .
	1. Create a redhat account using redhat.com
	2. go to https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox
	3. Click on the ? on top right corner post going inside sandbox dashboard.
	4. Download the windows zip , unzip it , place it in a User folder 
	5. copy the path of the extracted folder till oc.app file and add it to the ENV variable ---> user variables 
	6. open a terminal and type oc olaaaaaaa ! it started recognising.
	
	NOTE *** : THE ABOVE STEPS WILL LEAD TO CREAT THE OPENSHIFT DASHBOARD SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID BEFORE AND FROM THERE WE CAN COPY THE LOGIN COMMAND AND USE THAT TO CONNECT OUR LOCAL SYSTEM TERMINAL WITH IT FOR INTERACTION.
	
	7. Now clone a code from https://gitlab.com/practical-openshift/labs to see the other steps .
