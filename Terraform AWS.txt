It is used to install or create infra on AWS or any other cloud provider .
Instll Terraform cli 
Install Aws cli : aws configur eto configure the aws account to want to work on and its resources.
Once aws cli is install . You can go to your account -- > IAM -- > users --- > Top right corner select admin accont --> secret access keys and then generate and use it 

Command aws configure  : 
    - > access key id 
    - > secert access key

1. Terraform workflow and command : 
    a. Terraform init : initial the directory where wrote the terraform scripts and downloaf the providers and liberaries needed.
    b. Terraform validate  : Validate the syntax of the terraform script we wrote 
    c. Terraform Plan : Which will tell you what is about to be created/update/destroy and how.
    d. Terraform apply : which will create the resources to the aws cloud  .
    e. Terraform destroy : which will destroy the resource on aws cloud.
2. Terraform code files are terraform configuration files.
Note : We should be running the above commands in the working directory where the tf files rae thre.

3. tf anatomy : 

        <Block Type> <Block label1 >  <Block label2> {
                Argument identifier = Arguments values.

            }

Example : resource is the block type and so on as other values.
        resource "aws_instance" "ec2demo" {
                    AMI = "ami-uuwjjjjss"
                    PROCESSOR = "AMDreon"
                }

        - Blocks  : like resources , variable , data etc 
        - Provisioners blocks : Like tags etc 
        - Block labels : which is like resources "aws_instance" "ec2demo"  ----> two lables are there.
        - Arguments : Which is inside the blocks.
                    like AMI , Processor ,etc
    
4. To run the teaaform script below steps is pre-requisite : 
        - Default vpc should be there 
        - AMI for the EC2 you want to create shold be in the region avaialbe 
        - Verify your creds you configure for aws login in $HOME/.aws/configure  : C:\Users\harmeet.y.singh\.aws\credentials.

5.  Arguments , meta arguments and Attributes  and labels 
    - Labels  :     
        The second labels can be anything . The first label should ne hashicorps standard based. like aws_instance is a valid one and aws_instance_demo is not a valid one .
    - Arguments :         
        These are used to configure the resources and are eith required or optional .
        Always look for the documentation to check for the rquired and optional fields.
    - Attributes : 
        Attributes really points to the configuration assigned by the underlying provider to the resource we create using the arguments .
        These attributes can also be used in other resources in case we need it in format : resource_type.resource_name.attribute_name.
        For example for above ec2 
                aws_instance.ec2demo.publicip : This is the attribute we can use after creattion of ec2 instances.
