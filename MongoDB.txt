Mongo Db : its a Data base . Which is a no sql Database and helps in providing a way to store data in no schema based constraints.

Just like we have Tables in sql db , we have Collections in mongo db 
Just like we rows in tables in sql db , we have documents in mongo db 

1. the documents can be stored irrespective of the schema . 
	For example " 
							DB : Shop 
					Collections : Users 
					Documents :  1. { "name" : "Max" , "products": "sadwitch"}
					Documents :  2. { "name" : "Max" , "products": "sadwitch", "itemmodel":"model1"}
					Documents :  3. { "name" : "Max" , "products": "sadwitch", "id":90}
					Documents :  4. { "name" : "Max" , "products": "sadwitch", "itemmodel":"model1","id":90}
					
	No schema based means we don't need to stick to the number of fields value to be part of the documents which in case of sql tables columns as needed to be filled .

2. Documents are json format .
3. Provide flexibility to the documents it can grow more and more as per the fields in the documents.
4. As we know in sql the Normalised means the data is scattered across tables we used ralations to get that data. Mongos documents which is in json helps in adding nested objects
		which actually shows a kind of relationship between the data in collections.
		Like Items is the nested object inside.
		
{
  "name": "Max",
  "products": "sadwitch",
  "itemmodel": "model1",
  "id": 90,
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": 90,
      "product_number": 90,
      "product_expiry_date": "12/09/2022"
    }
  ]
}
5. A better querying mechanism to speed up the process of getting the data from a single collection.

NOte : ultimately the data stored will end up in the file directory on your system or on the device where the mongodb isrunning.
		
6. Mongo Db ecosystem : We will use community edition 

7. Just dwnload the msi from mongodb.com community edition and that will install server , client shell(to interact  with mongodb)and compass(gui) to interact with the db 

Command to start and stop the mongo service.
	net stop MongoDb 
	net start MongoDb
	
Once install run the client shell and there you can run all the mongoDb commands.

location for the shell : c:/Program Files/MongoDb/Server/5.0/bin/mongo.exe

8. Install MongoDB shell : in case mongo shell is not present in above installer. Download it from mongodb shell 

while installing it ask for this folder : C:\Users\IBMADMIN\AppData\Local\Programs\mongosh\

Click on mongosh and enter the mongodb connection sting for mongodb server which will hold the DB ----> collection ---> documents  or run mongosh command on cmd
connection string for example : mongodb://localhost:27017
