This will help in discovery of the assets on your environment and allow you identify the assets easily which are not protected.


1. Twistlock protects your cloud native assets anywhere they operate—whether you’rerunning containers, serverless functions, non-container hosts, or any combination of 
them. Advanced threat intelligence and machine learning enable protection of your entire cloud native stack, whether it runs in the public cloud, private cloud, or airgapped environment


2. Twistlock provides an agentless architecture that requires no changes to your host ,container engine, or applications. Twistlock is deployed as a set of containers, as a 
service on your hosts, or as a runtime component of your serverless function. For environments that do not support deployment of Twistlock as a privileged peer, we 
offer runtime application self protection (RASP) capabilities.

3. Upon deployment, Twistlock immediately begins working to secure your container and cloud environment. Twistlock supports discovery of assets within your cloud 
environment, allowing you to easily identify assets which are not protected and add them.

4. wistlock is easily integrated into your container build process with support for continuous integration (CI) systems and registry/serverless repository scanning 
capabilities.
