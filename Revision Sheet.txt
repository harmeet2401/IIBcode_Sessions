ArrayList : list of values , inserts and add the value in same order.
		 index based insertion , in order to get the value or search the value need to traverse the entire list 

Hashmap : Key  value data structure . it is faster then arrayList 
			Based on hashing . a hashmap bucket is stored in heap memory to hold an array , Each arrau index contains a single linked list .
			A hash function is used to generate the index value using the key provided and push the value to that idex.
			hash function is used to get the value when we provide the key which gen the index value from where to get the value .
			
Hashset : Its not index based DS . It helps in removing the duplicacy .
				
Linked List : will work on non index based DS. Each elements contains a data and a pointer location to next element 
faster then ArrayList

TreeSet : its also non index based . Can remove duplcacy and sort the data in ascending order.

Hashtable : its similar to hashmap and are synchrounised .

Treemap  :  but sort the data in natural order. simiar to hashmap .

Linkedhashmap : similar to hashmap but maintains the order.

Linkedhashset  : this will remove duplicacy and similar to hashset but maintain the order.

Queue : FIFO

------ 
what is java 
jre 
jdk
jvm 
Objects creation 
heap memory 
object and  instance vari is in heap memory
local variable and methods are in stack memory 
Refeenec variable person p = new perons()
				 ----------
					ref var 
Access modifiers : 
public 
protected 
private 
default 
--------------
iterface  : used by implements keyword . consists only abstract function declarations . used when we know donstream contains diff function defination 
abstract class : used using extend keyword , consists of mixed functions (fun dec and func defination ) , when we know downstream contains diff and unique functionality 
--------
Keyword : final variable : value can not be changed 
			final class : can not extend it 
			 final mehthod : can be overloaded (means we can change the paramters , return type etc of the function name post extending it from the base class)
			 
		: static variable : unique value for all the objects or the instance of the class . we can use this variable by using the class name and dot operator 
           static inner class : this class can be instantiated without instantiating the upper class of it 
			 static method : this function can be called using the class name and dot operator. 
			   only static members calles the static class , variable and method .
			   
---------------
Collections : 
	arraylist : index based DS . need iterator to traverse through all elements . somewhat slower then other DS
	hashset  : not indx bases , remove the duplicacy . If added duplicate elements will be removed auto.
	hashmap  : key , value pair DS . based on hashing . In memory hash table that contains array . Each index in that array contains linked list . hashFN used to get the index value. Key can  be null 
	linkedList : combination of (value |address of next node -------> value|address of next node) faster then arraylist.
	treeset   : Non index based DS , remove the duplicacy and sort the elements in natural order (ascending order.) . 
	treemap   : Non index based DS , sort in natural order. Key value pair DS . Null key is not allowed.
	hashtable : key value pair and is thread safe means its synchrounised. only one thread at a time . Removed duplicacy . null key is not allowed.
	linkedhashset : similar to hashset , maintain the order of the elements entered
	linkedhashmap : similar to hashset , maintain the order of the elements entered
	vector : its a synchrounised and thread safe . Can not work in multithreaded env or setup . Somewhat slower and not usable in multi - threaded env.
	queuee : works on FIFO first in first out method .
Collections interface allow many functions to be used for collections 
		Collections.sort  --- ascending order
		collections.shuffle
		collections.min
		collections.max
		collections.sort(list,collections.reverserOrder) -- descending order 
		
--------------
Exceptions : 
		checked exp : which is the compile time excpetion and if occurs will not allow create the .class file .
		unchecked exp : which is the runtime exception and it doesn't occured while compile time. This occurs at runtime post .class is done 
--------------
Synchronised block : only one thread can execute the block and will lock it for the others threads to come .
synchrounised methods : only one thread can execute the method and will lock ot for the other threads to come.
volatile variable : this will make it thread safe and will allow oly thread to change the value of the variable 
--------------
Spring boot : 
			actuator : health check ui 
			circuit breaker : used in fault tolereance 
-------------- 
REST api : Represntation state transfer : is the methodology for best use of  http protocol 
methods : GEt , post , put , patch , delete etc and get is idenpotent means same response will come untill a change in data take place .
--------------
OAUTH2 : O Authorization : its the protocol used for secure access to the resource for a REST api .
Its depends on the client id and client secret. These two props are provided by the api auth server.

Its two way authentication using the grant token 

First request for access approval -------------------->
									<----------Approved --
									---sends request for grant token ----->
									<----receive grant token --------------
									Get logged in

https://www.sanfoundry.com/mongodb-questions-answers-basics/
MongoDb : Its no sql bases data base depends upon the collections and documents .
collections are the tables and documents are the row. 	
Secondary indices are not available in MongoDB
writtern in C C++ javascript etc .
MongoDB has been adopted as backend software by a number of major websites and services.
Documents (objects) map nicely to programming language data types.
---------------				
Premitive and non premitive datatypes : 
	Premitive datatypes include : int , byte , char , long , double , short , float boolean etc 
	Non premitive data type are : String , Array etc 
	
--------------------
Wrapper classes : which is used for user defined data types : 
		We can use wrapper classses in collections classes to defined the data .
		ArrayLIst<Character> arr = new ArrayLIst<Character>();
		ArrayLIst<Integer> arr = new ArrayLIst<Integer>();
		ArrayLIst<Boolean> arr = new ArrayLIst<Boolean>();
		ArrayLIst<Person> arr = new ArrayLIst<Person>();
-----------------------
Stringbuffer and stringbuilder are immutable classes we can use these classes to append or concatenate the strings easily 
Stringbuffer str = new Stringbuffer("String to be test");
Stringbuilder str = new Stringbuilder("String to be test");
----------------------
constructor : 
	Whenever we create a constructor of a class compiler adds a Super() method at very first steps of the constructor.

public class ABS {
	
	private ABS (){
			super();
			
	}

}
		
Keywords : super() --- points to the base class constructor		
			super.  ----- this will give you list of methods and variable of the base class tobe used.
			this() --- this will call theconstructor of the same class 
			this. ---- this will show the methods and variables declared in same class 
-------------------------
Autoboxing : its the type cast used from premitive to non=premitive data types 
				example:   
				Integer i = new Integer(9999);
				Character i = new Integer(c);  or Character c = 'a';
				Float i = new Flat(9999.9900); or Float f = 999.90;
	Giving us the advantage of using all methods in Wrapper class Integer , character etc 

AUTOUNBOX : 
		Integer i = 100;
		int a = i;  -- this Auto unbox
