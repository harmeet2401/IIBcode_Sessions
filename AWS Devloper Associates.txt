AWS Devloper associates:

1.Advantages of Cloud : 

	On demand provisioning of infra 
	Avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting : We can spin up the db in small time interval.
	No Upfront cost .

	This course will help in developing apps ready for the cloud.
Q1.Why AWS : ?
leading client of AWS .

1. Search for IAM 
2. Left side click on user groups

steps to create a IAM user user and add it to the above IAM group 
1. Select user from left side
2. click on create user 
3. select : you want to create an iam user 
4. select : you want to create custom password
5. select the group you want the user to add in .

Now use this link we copied form the console user page : 
https://860574603717.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
user name : meet101
password: Gogi@12345

change change the password to : Gogi@667335424


#3 Sevices which can be spin up in different regions based on our requirements.
For example : 
IAM service is a global service.
Compute serices are region specific which means we can switch the region from the console and sping the compute service in that particular region . Or may be we can select the region whihle selecting and cofiguring the service.

Availibility region :------------> Availibility Zones -----------> Data center

Features of EC2 service : 
	- Will allow user to control the lifecycle of the EC2 instance and it application 
	- Will allow to load balancing and autoscale the instance as per the traffic and utilization 
	- Allows to attach or detach the storage device and allow backup features .
	- Allows network connectivity which will help in creating a microservice architecture in case needed.
	
	
	
Steps to launch an ec2 instanec: 
1. select the ec2 instance 
2. Select the AMI Amazon Machine Image which is the precooked image with all operating system and webserver required.
3. Select the storage to attach
4 Select the security or create the security griup needed as a fireewall.
