Q : Rest Defination : Representation state transfer is the protocol to allow best use of HTTP protocol and help in trasferring data across net using HTTP/Https protocol.
Q : Rest operations  : 
HTTP GET : To get the request on a path . Its idempotent , means it will keep on sending the same data back to client untill the data is changed by other PUT and post methods.
HTTP POST : To create and post new  data from client to the api. It is applied on the collections of data . example : http put ; http://localhost:8080/user
HTTP PUT :  Should only be used if you’re replacing a resource in its entirety. It is applied on a single item  example : http put ; http://localhost:8080/user/1
HTTP DELETE : To delete the data from the api server .DELETE operations are idempotent
HTTP PATCH : is the correct choice for partially updating an existing resource.The PATCH method is not a replacement for the POST or PUT methods. It applies a delta (diff) rather than replacing the entire resource. Means it is used to change the partiall value of an object  , example : the user have : email  , add , name . so changing the name only can be done using the patch operations

Q : Diff between ArrayList and Vector.
ArrayList																	Vector
1) ArrayList is not synchronized.										Vector is synchronized. Which is used in directional parameter
	
2) ArrayList increments 50% of current array  							Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size if the
size if the number of elements exceeds from its capacity.				 total number of elements exceeds than its capacity.
	
3) ArrayList is not a legacy class. It is introduced in JDK 1.2.		Vector is a legacy class.
	
4) ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized.					Vector is slow because it is synchronized, i.e., in a multithreading environment, it holds the other threads in 																  runnable or non-runnable state until current thread releases the lock of the object.
	
5) ArrayList uses the Iterator interface to traverse the elements.		 Vector can use the Iterator interface or Enumeration interface to traverse the elements.

Enumeration interface or iterator interface is used to iterate elements from stack , vector and hashtables.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iterator is an interface which is used to iterate the collections likes Hashmap , ArrayList ,hashset , linkedlist etc.
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Make a collection
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");

    // Get the iterator
    Iterator<String> it = cars.iterator();   String non-primitive

    // Print the first item
    System.out.println(it.next());
  }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Java Patterns : 
	1. Creational Design Patterns
		a. Singleton Pattern --------------imp Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java virtual machine. We can implement that as .mention the constructor as private  .Keep only one global access to class for the instance .one static block for instantiation.
		
										
										
		b. Factory Pattern ----------imp The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class
		Example : One abstract class Class_Super contains three functions 
		
				  two classes class A and class B extends Class_Super and overrides the defination of its functions .
				  
				  Third class Class_factory returns the instance of Class A or Class B on some if conditions  which is an example of factory methods.
		
		c. Abstract Factory Pattern - In Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class and then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class
						1. one interface  Color . one method : getcolor();
						2. one class blue implements color . method override getcolor : sout("blue color ")
						
						3. one interface shape . one mthoed : getshape();
						4. one class square implements shape. method override getShape :sout("square").
						
						5. one abstract class abstractFactory . one method Shape getShape(String str) , one method Color getcolor(String str );
						6. Class shapeFactory extends abstract . Override method getShape(String shapetype) :
																			if(shapetype==squre){
																				return new Square();
																				
																			} ////// this is called Abstract Factory pattern in which we used an another abstract class ot get the object of implementing classes on some condition .
																				
			
		
		d. Builder Pattern : steps by step procedure to create complex objects .Main advantage of builder design pattern is that it provides better control over object construction process.
		e. Prototype Pattern : Prototype pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/prototype_pattern.htm
		
		Here in this we create an abstract class which extends cloneable 
		for exmaple 
			a. Abstract class Shape implements Cloneable interface 
				Some methods 
			b. One class cirle extends shape , define one function 
			c. one class square extends shape , define and override the functions .
			d. one class rectangle extends shape , define and override the functions .
			
			e. ShapecacheClas , which load the cache(use hashtable DS) in one method  and then one method does the clone .
	
	2. Structural Design Patterns
		a. Adapter Pattern --------imp The adapter design pattern is one of the structural design patterns and it’s used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together.Its just like we have a program that allow communications between two discretesystems. 
		b. Composite Pattern
		c. Proxy Pattern
		d. Flyweight Pattern
		
		e. Facade Pattern ---imp Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. Creating a class which is exposing the class functionality to do acess the system and not able see the attributes.
		
		f. Bridge Pattern
		g. Decorator Pattern
	
	3. Behavioral Design Patterns
		a. Template Method Pattern
		b. Mediator Pattern
		c. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
		d. Observer Pattern
		e. Strategy Pattern
		f. Command Pattern
		g. State Pattern
		h. Visitor Pattern
		i. Interpreter Pattern
		j. Iterator Pattern
		k. Memento Pattern
	
	4. Miscellaneous Design Patterns
		a. DAO Design Pattern -- DAO design pattern is used to decouple the data persistence logic to a separate layer. DAO is a very popular pattern when we design systems to work with databases. Just like we kept the DB intracting logical functions in a class. We did that in JPA implementation.
		
		
		b. Dependency Injection Pattern : Its a technique using which we can make the client class independent from the dependant class . means in case of class A implements the iterface and using Dependency injection we can make instance of interface available for Class A .
			for example : Service Service = new ServiceB();
			Service is the interface and ServiceB is the class which implements the Service interface . ServiceB might be overriding the function's definations.
											
											Interface Service
												|		|
												|		| Implements
												|		|
										Service A    Service B
										
										
										Class A Implements service class and can inject the functions of other two implementation service A and Service B in it.like that the dependency of Service A and Service B on class A is removed and is loosely coupled.
										
		
		c. MVC Pattern : this design pattern applies on the Web applications . 
					M means model , V means view of the application showing the fetched data , C is the Controller of the app which contolls the flow of the app.
					
					Model shows the business model 
					View means shoing the html format data comes from the controller 
					Controller is the back end module that handles the flow. 


Q : Fetch api or Api 
		So fetch api is just an another javascript tool to invoke an existing rest api to get the data back and process it .
		fetch("url to hit " , method.put/post/get)

Q : Circuit breaker : This is another feature that spring boot provide , Resilience is one of the example . To provide circuit braker and same we can define the fallback function
Q : Spring Actuator : It will be used to provide health check feature to the api you create . 
Q : Difference between Abstract class and interface .

		- Both the classes have method names declard without body defination .
		- A single class can implements multiple interfaces in one go . 
		- A single class can extends only one abstract class  in one go .
		- Interfaces only abtract methods are present in it.
		- Abstract contains both abstract fuction and non abstract function.
		- Both interface and abstract class can not be instantiated , means we can not create object of it , but we an use the class which implements to generate the instance of it.
		- All functions in interface are abstracts . Mixed fucntion are present in abstract classes .
		- We can use interfcae when we knew all features of an entityt have different values .
		- We can use abstract class in case we know some features of entityt have diff values and some have constant , remember the WWE example.
		- And both above provides and advantage of not writting the function in the implemented class if 1000 of functions are required to be writtern.
		- But what happened if we want to add one more function in interface and 1000 classes have implemented the interface then we ave to go in each class and add the newly added - functions and its defination. To overcome that we can use default keyword function defined in interface and then we can direcly call it .
Q : Fault Tolerance in spring boot : Resilience4j is one of the tool opensource provided by Netflix to add feature of retry (when app is down) , cirtcuit breaker (when in a chain of microservice  , one of the microservice is down ) , Rate limiter ( to controler the outgoing request to downstream Micro)  and bulkload.
Q ; Primitive data types .
Primitive data types - These are the data types which are defined by java already in its liberary .includes byte, short, int, long, float, double and char ---- BSILFDBC
Non-primitive data types - These data types are not defined in java , user create it. such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter) --- SAC

Note  : Float end with F  , doubel ends with D , Long ends with L
Q : Completeable future : A CompltableFuture is used for asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming means writing non-blocking code. It runs a task on a separate thread than the main application thread and notifies the main thread about its progress, completion or failure.

Q : Checked and unchecked exceptions : 
Checked exception are those which can be checked by the compiler at the verry first stage of writting the code and ask for report it using try catch . There are some specific java classes which help in checking the compile time or checked exception .
Unchecked exception are those which the compiler usually ignore and occured at runtime . There are other java classes which can catch the unchecked exceptions which are ignored by checked exceptions .



Q : Static inner class :
class A {

static class b{
		public void innerfunction(){
			SOUT("static inner class");
		}
	}
	
	psvm(){
			A.b objectb = new A.b();
			objectb.innerfunction();
	}
}


Q : Super() function . Whenever we call a constructor of base class by cretaing the object for it  , the compiler will add a super( )function in default constructor of base class which in turn call the default constructor of super class. coooool , even if you dont mention  super() will be there .
We can add a parameterized constructor and then call it by giving value and use the super()function accordingly.

Q : Mongo Db :https://www.sanfoundry.com/mongodb-questions-answers-basics/
 session is really nce , it works using collections (tables) and documents (Rows of table) structure.
	We have mongodb collection schema also to validate the collections data . Documents will fail on validation .
	Secondary indices are not available in MongoDB.
	MMS stands for MongoDB Management Service and is available to all users in the cloud and on-premises as part of MongoDB Standard and Enterprise Subscriptions.
	use dbname : -------- to use the db name or switch to it
	MongoImport  : to import the data.
	mongoExport : To export the data in json
	mongodump : to get the data in BSON (back end stored data in mongo db )
	db.states.find() : to run the query just like the where clause
	db.states.find({"states":"Delhi"})
	db.states.find({"states":"Delhi","District":"south delhi"}) ---- comma , is for and 
    db.states.count() --- to count the documents 	
	db.democollection.insert([{"_id":1,"firstname":"Harmeet","lastname":"singh"}]) --------- to insert the dcument in collection name example : democollection
	If the db and collection (table) name is not there then while running insert and use command it will auto create those for us.

Q : WHAT WILL BE THE OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM ? -------------------- MULTI CHOICE
Q : JAVA-------------------- MULTI CHOICE
Q : JAVA 8-------------------- MULTI CHOICE
Q : APIS :COMPONENT FUNCTIONALITY TESTING-------------------- MULTI CHOICE
		Component Testing is also referred to as Unit Testing, Program Testing or Module Testing.
		
		
Q : REST API REPRESENTATIONS FOR RESOURCES.-------------------- MULTI CHOICE
		The Resource in a REST api is the data which is sent in the response . When we finalize the resource then we will decide the format of the resource (Entity) to be sent in .
		REST does not impose any restriction on Format  : so we can send data in XML , HTML , JSON etc .
		
Q : HTTP POST METHOD -------------------- MULTI CHOICE : To create new objects in the api servers .

Q : CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING (CORES)  IN REST -------------------- MULTI CHOICE
		Its the feature to alllow cross orgin communication to the Api we are hitting From api client .
		Origin is nothis but the combination of protocol(scheme) , host and port the api is listening on .
		for example : http://org.com/800 and https://org.net/900 is not same origin .
		So when the api client to access the api from a wrong origin hit on te browser and reached the Api , it blocks those request and send ooops srry 
		
		exmaple : 
		
		harmeet ----------------------------> browser (using http://ibm.com/9090 (valid origin)) -----------req reached -------> IBM api checkd the origin which is allowed send ok !.
		
		harmeet ----------------------------> broswer (using http://ibm.net/9090) (invalid origin )--------req reached -----> IBM api checks its invalid/not same origin will reject he request and say srrryyyy

Q : FETCH API -------------------- MULTI CHOICE
Q : VALID URI FORMAT -------------------- MULTI CHOICE
	Rule #1: A trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs
	Rule #2: Forward slash separator (/) must be used to indicate a hierarchical relationship For example:
http://api.canvas.com/shapes/polygons/quadrilaterals/squares

	Rule #3: Hyphens (-) should be used to improve the readability of URIs exmaple : http://api.example.com/blogs/guy-levin/posts/this-is-my-first-post
	Rule #4: Underscores (_) should not be used in URIs.
	Rule #5: Lowercase letters should be preferred in URI paths
	Rule #6: File extensions should not be included in URIs

Q : GOOD URI DESIGN JAVA REST -------------------- MULTI CHOICE
Q : SPRING DATA -------------------- MULTI CHOICE :  Its the feature of spring which we can find in docs.spring.io . We can download or refer spring data to bring data access features into our projects like , JDBCtemplate , MongoTemplate etc.

Q : OAUTH2-------------------- MULTI CHOICE :  https://www.w3cschool.cn/oauth2/5ghz1jab.html
OAuth 2.0 lists four different types of authorization approvals, each with different security features. These authorization approval types are:

-authorization code
-indenture
-the resource owner key certificate
-client certificate
-each authorization approval is mentioned below.

OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.
OAuth2(Open Authorization) is an authorization framework that enables the application Web Security to access the resources from the client. To build an OAuth2 application, we need to focus on the Grant Type (Authorization code), Client ID and Client secret.

			Example 
						client id and client secret is given by the bank detail showing app to the kotak Auth server ,when it got registered to the kotak mahindras authorization api.
						kotak mahindras authorization api gives the client id and client secret .
	 
		
		Harmeet using 
	Bank Details Showing app
			|
			|----------------------- Using app send an authorization request (client id and client secret)access to ------> Kotak Authorization service(api) This can be a class
			|
			|<------------------------send an authorization approval ---------------------------------------------------
			|
			|------------------------Authorization grant code request -------------------------------------------------->
			|
			|<------------------------get a token back ------------------------------------------------------------------
			|
			|---------------------------------using that token -----------------------------access the ------------------> Kotak mahindras api for harmeet's bank details using the Resource lke controller
			
			
So we can do like this in spring boot api 

				A controller class
				A user bean entity class for response message 
				An AuthorizationServer java class which extends authorizationServerConfigureAdapter. Annotated as @Configuration , @EnableAuthorizationServer.

Q : java Collections : java.util
	Collections : 
	  @. ArrayList  : Its class in java.util and helps in holding the collection of data . Like collection of string , integer  ,LOg , Decimal etc , ex : ArrayList<String> li = new  ArrayList<>();. ArrayList data is dynamic means we can increase the size or dec the size accordingly.
	  @. LinkedLIst : LinkedLIst is almost similar to ArrayList holds a type of data collections LinkedLIst<String> linklist = new LinkedLIst<>(). But the elements are placed in container in LinkedLIst which are connected where as the elements are placed in array in ArrayList. LinkedLIst have more function like AddFirst , addLast , getAdd , getLast , removelast , removeFirst.
	  @. hashmap : It stores the data in Key:Value pair , key and value can be of diff type or of same type as well.
	  @. Collections : Its an class in java.util package and helps in sorting the words alphabetically  , Sorting can happen on both integer and string in ascending order 
	  @. HashSet : A HashSet is a collection of items where every item is UNIQUE, and it is found in the java.util package. if you add a duplicate element it will store only the unique ones and remove one copy of duplicate(same size , same caps or lower) for example HashSet = BMW , BMW , bmw  , it will store as hashset = [BMW , bmw]
	  @. Iterator : so we studied collections , now to loop through these collections we use Iterator.
	  
	Collections : 
		- Collections.copy(arrayList,arrayList1); // copy fist list to another
        - Collections.sort(arrayList1); // sort second list ascending
        - Collections.shuffle(arrayList1); // shuffle the elemenst 
		- int max = Collections.max(arrayList);  --------- to find the min of the list value 
        - int min = Collections.min(arrayList); ------------ to find the maximum of the is value 
		- Collections.reverse(ar) -- will sort the collections in Descending order.
		  Collections.sort(list , Collections.reverseOrder())  --- will do in reverse order and descending order
		
	Integer : 
		- We can convert from char to interger using Character static class .
		- int a = Character.getNumericValue(c);    ---------------- where c is the character 
		
	To get the unicode value of Character	
		- use str.codePointAt(indexvalue)
		- use str.codePointBefore(indexvalue)
		- use int ctr = str.codePointCount(1, 10);

	String : 
		- int count = str1.compareTo(str2)   ----------------------- consider case 
		- int count_time = str1.compareToIgnoreCase(str2) ---------- ignore alphabet case.
		Compares two strings lexicographically. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings. The character sequence represented by this String object is compared lexicographically to the character sequence represented by the argument string.
	
	StringBuilder ,StringBuffer : 
		- StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder("Harmeet Singh");
			str.append();
			str.reverse();
			
		
		
		
	We can use Lambda expression on all above collection java.util classes verry easily .	
	
Q. Wrapper classes : 	 In collections we use wrapper classes as we can not use primitive data types in collections to store data .
		ArrayList<int> alist = new ArrayList<int>(); // invalid
		ArrayList<Integer> alist = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // valid
		
		Where Integer is the wrapper class.
		These classes are ussed to wrap primitive data types like : boolean , byte , char , int , long , short , double , float etc 
		
		primitive data types 				Wrapper class 
		boolean									Boolean
		byte									Byte 
		char									Character
		int										Integer
		long									Long
		short									Short
		double									Double
		float									Float

	Notes 	We can understand it like this : we can declared the wrapper class object as this Boolean b = new Boolean(false) ; ------> in this , the constructor is used to hold the primitive data value.


Q : Java Spring bean scope : The spring context container holds all the components which are on the classpath or annotated or configured . So if we create a bean class or entity .
	Asking the getBean method from spring context for that bean class. We can get the hashcode of that class object which make the scope categories as below.
	We have 5 scopes : 
		singleton  :  The hascode of the object using getBean from spring context will give the same hashcode. When we do GetBean the spring context will gve the reference copy of the object to you . 
		prototype : The hashcode of the objects using the getBean from spring context will give different hashcode. We can use @Scope("prototype").
		request  : This helps in rest api.
		session : this is also used in rest api .
		globalsession.
Q : Spring container : Spring IOC container maintain the entire lifecycle of the objects from the creation of the objects till destruction of it . It also help in inject the dependency . The only thing we need to give it is the beans(POJO) and the config for it. Its just like a separate program like for example a garbage collector .
ApplicationContext is the container that loads and traverse through the classpath create the objects , inject the dependency and add all the components to it .
So whenever we want to see the components in it we can easily do 
		ApplicationContext app = new ApplicationContext();
		Test test = app.getBean("ob",Test.class);
ApplicationContext is a corner stone of a Spring Boot application. It represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans.
ApplicationContext is implemented in AnnotationConfigApplicationcontext  ,FilesystemXmlApplicationcontext , classpathXmlApplicationcontext. etc 
		
		
		
Q : Spring config server  : its one of the spring boot feature which helps in externalise the data our app is using which can be confidential ina centralized repository .
							for this feature we can use spring cloud config server in one Micro and spring cloud client in other Micro who wants to join server.

Q : Coding challlenge 
----------------------------------------------------------
NOtes : Importanat : 
1.str.toCharArray() can break down the string to character and we can store it in char[]
2.StringBuilder Class we ca use to reverse a string easily.
3.Character class we can use to convert a char to uppercase or lower case and can also check if its in upper case or lower case.
 Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        name = sc.nextLine(); to read the string 
		       sc.nextint(); to read the integer.
4. We can use collection as much as we can . it provides remove function and collections class help in sorting the collection classes (arraylist , linkedlist ,hashmap,hashset , etc)			   
5. We can use String str = ""
					str.split(regex:"\\s")  ; --- > this regex is for space . and will divide the sentence or a long string into set of words.
					str.matched(regex:"([a-zA-Z]+[.,?!\-]*)+"). to check its a string.
6. A char is actually just stored as a number (its code point value). We have syntax to represent characters like char c = 'A';, but it's equivalent to char c = 65; and 'A' == 65 is true.  https://www.asciitable.com/  . The int code for A is diff then small a

So in your code, the chars are being represented by their decimal values to do arithmetic (whole numbers from 0 to 65,535).

##########################################################################################################

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lambda Expression : 
Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8.

A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

example : 

(n) -> { System.out.println(n); }     -------- its like a function without name and fnction body is writtern after -> in curly braces .

We can use consumer interface to store the lambda expression .
Consumer<Integer> method = (n) -> { System.out.println(n); };
    numbers.forEach( method );


1. The static block will execute whenever the class is loaded by JVM.
Instance block will execute whenever an object is created, and they are invoked before the constructors. For example, if there are two objects, the instance block will execute two times for each object.
The constructor will execute after the instance block, and it also execute every time the object is created.
A method is always executed at the end.

2. The \u0021 article referred to as a Unicode escape sequence

3. In Java, the return type of hashCode() method is an integer, as it returns a hash code value for the object.

4.  For every long literal to be recognized by Java, we need to add L character at the end of the expression

5. if we divide 1/0 will give positive infinity, -1/0 will give negative infinity, and 0/0 will give NaN.

6. if  x = 1 

to find the output of ++x  if x = 1
	result = ++x   ------------------------ out put will be 2 as ++ is the closer or higher precedence operator and will get increment first
	result = x++ ------------------------- output will be 3 bcse the '=' has a pre operator closer to X and will execute first and assign the value of x to result , post that x will be incremented
	this is moslty used in looping . So in forloop you can mentions x++ this will allow first iteration to go with x = 1 and get incremented in next round 
	if ++x the first iteration itself with go with 2
7.The Javadoc is a tool that is used to generate API documentation in HTML format from the Java source files. In other words, it is a program (tool) that reads a collection of source files into an internal form
